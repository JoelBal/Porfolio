# Porfolio

When completing this assignement 
I was able to start with creating a repository
Using HTML I was able to create a Header with clickable links
After that I was able to add an image to the page through html
Then I was able to direct the clickable HTML to an image
When that was done I added CSS to to style borders add borders and color to the page.










Here is the deployed application
